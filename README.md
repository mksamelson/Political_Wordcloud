Word clouds can provide interesting and fun insight intention what a politician is saying. These are quite effective when high-level, thematic extraction is desired. Want to know what they are saying in a snap? Use a word cloud.

A word cloud is a visual representation of words arranged artistically in close proximity. The size of each word’s type is proportional to the word’s frequency.

A word cloud doesn’t provide sentiment - the emotional significance of the briefing as distinct from its verbal content.

If we assume word usage is correlated with message (a reasonable but unscientific assumption), we can get a snapshot of message at a glance as opposed to listening to a press briefing transcript for 10 minutes.
